    \item Introduction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The Process} - from Request for Qualifications and Proposal for initial Planning to Opening Day for the Project.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Where it begins
            \item A ``Need'' is identified
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Owner needs to develop property purchased to lease for income (return on investment)
                \item Inspectors note that deck deterioration is advanced and needs repair/replacement.
                \item Trafic demands have grown to regularly ``jam'' the route and no viable alternates are available.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Scope developed - usually by owner or owner's representative (program manager for major projects)
            \item Request for Qualifications (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP) for Design issued by Owners
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Lists \textit{qualifications} needed - (Sometimes 2-step process: RFQ first and shortlisted teams get the RFP second).
                \item Objectives and Scope of Work are detailed
                \item Schedule is defined
                \item Criteria
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The Players} - Relationships among Owners, Designers, Builders (and sometimes Financers)
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Owner/Owner's Representative
                \item Designer/Engineer - Develops construction (or contract) Documents (CDs). Supports construction (reviews of Contractor's alternatives, RFIs, Means and Methods, relays design intent).
                \item Contractor - Bids on work defined in CDs. Lowest qualified bidder (usually) gets awarded the contract.
                \item Resident/Construction Inspector - Assures work is performed in accordace with CDs. Processes pay requisitions. Coordinates submissions to/from designer.
                \item Quality Control/Quality Assurance/Testing
                \item \textbf{Design-Bid-Build} Contractual relationships between owner and engineer and owner and contractor. Cooperative support between engineer and contractor.
                \item Roles civil engineers play: Designer, Resident/Owner's Representative, Contractor, Owner, Maintenance Engineer, QA/QC.
            \end{itemize}

                    \\ \textbf{Construction Oriented}: Contractor controlled, managed risk, better opportunity.
                    \item Progressive Design-Build: Owner \(\rightarrow\) 5-10\% Design and RFP \(\rightarrow\) PDB teams selected on qualifications, advance design with owner and owner's representative.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Private v. Public}: Who's in charge?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Architects tend to take lead on private work/buildings
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Contract with the owners
                \item Subcontract to structural, mechanical, electical, and plumbing designers

            \end{itemize}
            \item Civil Engineers tend to take the lead on public works/bridges
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Many major bridges do not have architectural involvement
